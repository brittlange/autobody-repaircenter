# Auto Body Repair Center

Includes planning and deliverables for the group project in the Data Analytics in Business class at Georgia Tech.

We used NYC Collision datasets to estimate the monthly demand for a fictitious auto shop in New York state by extrapolating the monthly car crash volume using various models (linear regression, random forest, CART, boosted trees, and ensemble) with reasonable accuracy. We also analyzed the effects of COVID-19 on NYC Collisions, including estimated lost revenue for the fictitious auto body shop, and estimated the improved market share through use of a marketing campaign.
